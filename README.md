I wish to create an app where users can read most of Lovecraft's recorded cosmic horror literatures.

Reason: Clarity of publishing Lovecracft literature. State if permission be allowed for anyone to publish.  

Reply: 

Short answer: Yes, **everyone has permission** to share his works and create derivations of his works. Not claim his works, only sharing and derivation.

Long answer:

Based on multiple sources:

- Wikisource (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Howard_Phillips_Lovecraft)
- Techdirt (https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110531/02515814477/confusing-case-lovecrafts-copyrights.shtml)
- Chaosium (https://www.chaosium.com/fan-use-and-licensing-q-a/)

They give the same conclusion, but Techdirt gives a bit more detail.

``To start off, any book published prior to 1923 is in the public domain. Some of Lovecraft's early works fall in this time period. But all of his most famous works, including "Call of Cthulhu," "Dreams in the Witch House," "At the Mountains of Madness" and so on were written after 1923. Before 1976, all works had to be registered with the copyright office to avoid falling into the public domain, and many of Lovecraft's works (the ones published in amateur presses) were almost certainly never registered. Additionally, any work published between the years 1923-1963, not only had to have been originally registered, but had to have that copyright renewed sometime between 1950 and 1992 to avoid avoid falling into the public domain. If it was renewed, then it is copyrighted until 95 years after publication. Unfortunately, there's no official database that explicitly lists which works published before 1963 had their copyright renewed. The Copyright Office has an online database of works renewed after 1977, but if the work was renewed from 1950-1977, that requires searching through the copyright office's database of physical paper records.``

``It is generally believed that Lovecraft retained all rights to his works published from 1926 forward (though we don't have documentation to confirm this). In the period 1923-25, he published a few works in amateur presses like The Tryout that didn't register their copyrights, and six works in Weird Tales, which did register its copyrights. Weird Tales did transfer whatever rights it held to [August] Derleth and [Donald] Wandrei and Arkham House in 1947 ... Of the rights to the remaining 21 works published from 1926-37, that Lovecraft retained rights to, his rights were transferred, upon his death in 1937, to his only heir, his aunt, Annie Gamwell. Gamwell transferred the royalties in her will to Derleth and Wandrei, but the copyrights she held and these were transferred to her heirs, Edna Lewis and Ethel Morrish. Lewis and Morrish subsequently transferred at least some of their rights to Arkham House in an agreement. The problem is that the language of the agreement in which Morrish and Lewis ostensibly gave rights to Derleth and Wandrei is not clear about what rights are being transferred.``

I won't share his still-copyrighted works, **only the ones considered to be under public domain**. But the rest of his literatures are considered public domain due to:

- Conflict in regional laws.
- Lack of proof; as in, there's no solid proof of copyright.
- Unregistered copyrights. So, the works are treated as public domain by default.

Those are reasons related to law directly. As for reasons related to his community; there are **numerous derived works based on Lovecraft's literatures** (games, literatures, maybe songs too and more). Everyone generally agree, maybe to some extent including the legal bodies, that (most of) Lovecraft's works are public domain. You can even just google the derived works and notice they're not even considered to be violating.
