MotoMaintenance

Motorcycle Maintenance apps

motorcycle need maintenance every 5000km. in current condition, it's not possible to go to workshop and wait there as chance of contracting with covid is really high. 
therefore I created an application that can be used to make it easier and educate ordinary people so that they can repair their own motorbikes. 
in this application there is a main menu, inside there will be form of a choice of motorbikes from 3 well-known brands in Indonesia, and enter the speedometer number. 
after that it will be taken to the next page in the form of what views must be repaired and replaced. 
if the repair is selected, it will show you how and the steps and tools needed to repair the motor. 
You will also be given a youtube link for those who want to know in more detail how to repair their own motorbike.
